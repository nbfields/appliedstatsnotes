  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is math 424 \textit{and} 531. What are the differences? Who knoooooows
    \item This is a synchronous remote course. Yaaay (well not really yay but whatever)
    \item The structure of the course will change based on what we say in our video so \textit{be careful}!
    \item We will be using R. Eh, there's worse things
    \item There will be lab assignments where we use R Markdown
    \item Assignments turned in via Gradescope
    \item Midterm 1, 2 are not cumulative, but the final is
    \item Book PDFs can be gotten easily through the Mines Library
    \item Linear algebra and matrix algebra are important. Also things like hypothesis testing, null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, confidence intervals. Review your notes
    \item Most students are taking 424, and those taking 531 are $ \frac{2}{3} $ from other departments. Some questions on the homework are for grad students only so don't worry about those~:P
    \item Look over class notes and consider reading the book as well
    \item All right, let's get started!
  \end{itemize}
